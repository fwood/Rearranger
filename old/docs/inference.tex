 \section{Posterior Inference over PDFAs}
 
 We perform posterior inference by sampling assignments for $\delta_{ij}$ individually.  Rather than ordinary Gibbs sampling, we use a mixed Gibbs/Metropolis-Hastings update.  To see why, consider the following case:  $\delta_{ij}$ is the only sampled element of $\delta$ that is assigned to the state $q_{i'}$.  When we removed $\delta_{ij}$ from the counts to sample it, the probability of assigning it back to $q_{i'}$ becomes zero, and even if it is assigned to some new state $q_{i''}$, the probability that $\delta_{i'j} = \delta_{i''j}$ for all $j$ visited by the data is low.  We do not want to forget a good sample, so instead we propose a new $\delta_{ij}$ and accept or reject according to the usual Metropolis-Hastings ratio.
 
Samples from the CRF are exchangeable, so we can remove $\delta_{ij}$ and propose a sample $\delta{ij}^*$ according to the CRF given $\delta_{-ij}^T$, the elements of $\delta$ visited by $x_{0:T}$ excluding $\delta_{ij}$.  This is the prior probability excluding the data, which cancels with the equivalent term in the posterior, meaning that the accept probability $\alpha(\delta_{ij},\delta_{ij}^*)$ is given by the ratio of the likelihood of the data

\[ \alpha(\delta_{ij},\delta_{ij}^*) =  \mathrm{min}\left(1,\frac{p(x_{0:T}|\delta_{ij}^*,\delta_{-ij}^T)}{p(x_{0:T}|\delta_{ij},\delta_{-ij}^T)}\right)\]

In general the numerator cannot be evaluated because changing $\delta_{ij}$ means changing the entire sequence of states visited by the data after $\delta_{ij}$ is first visited.  In practice we estimate the numerator by Monte Carlo approximation, sampling elements of $\delta$ according to the CRF as they are first visited by the data.  Changing one element of $\delta$ means many already-sampled state/symbol pairs may never be visited by the data, and have no effect on the likelihood.  The posterior probability of any value for these elements of $\delta$ is the same as the prior, and therefore we may remove them from $\delta^T$ after accepting a new $\delta_{ij}$.

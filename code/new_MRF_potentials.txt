Description of new parameters, including HARMONY, INTRA_PART NOTE MOVEMENT, VOICE LEADING.


HARMONY:
245x245 matrix(each note with another note simultaneously)

steps along scale (not dependent on where in overall note range, just where on octave-length scale):
0 (unison): 0
1: .9	(m2)
2: .8	(M2)
3: .3	(m3)
4: .2	(M3)
5: .5	(P4)
6: .9	(tritone)
7: .2	(P5)
8: .5	(m6)
9: .5	(M6)
10: .6	(m7)
11: .7	(M7)

rest: .5

part1 = S(1:49,:);
depending on the note in part 1, the notes in part 2 should have specific potentials, i.e. all notes should be lower in pitch than in part 1.  (not as applicable in other parts, given the difference in instruments)

e.g. if note = note 5 (in scale range, that's 5th from top);
--> note in part 2 must be between 5th and lowest note, with a constant on the rest.  lowest potentials are at octaves and consonant intervals (e.g. thirds and fifths), higher potentials at dissonant ones (e.g. minor seconds, major sevenths, tritone);

part2 = S(50:98,:);
part3 = S(99:147,:);
part4 = S(148:196,:);
part5 = S(197:245,:);


INTRA_PART NOTE MOVEMENT
(each note and note before it)
5 49x49 matrices
(probability of jumping from one note to another)

if rest & rest before, equal probability of going anywhere
if rest & note before, emphasis on proximity to previously voiced note
if note, (slightly heavier) emphasis on proximity to previous note

for each part:
(without having increased potentials for tritones/other dissonances)

this is one part's potential matrix
o = diag(ones(1,49));
for i=1:49
    o = o + diag(ones(1,i),49-i)*(i/49) + diag(ones(1,i),-(49-i))*(i/49);
    o(end,1:end-1) = ones(1,1:end-1)*.5;
    o(1:end-1,end) = ones(1:end-1,1)*.5;
    o(end) = .5;
    o = 1-o;
end


VOICE LEADING (MOVEMENT AMONG MULTIPLE PARTS)
(looking at how multiple instruments jump, parallel fifths)
if notes are fifth (or fourth) apart (five or seven half-steps), they cannot jump the same distance in the same direction

parallel fifths: .9
parallel fourths: .8
parallel octaves: .75
parallel thirds: .3

landing on/resolving to same note/octave (from different notes): .2



PITCH SPACING (AMONG MULTIPLE PARTS)
as mentioned before,

for first two parts (trumpet I & II), first part note should always be higher or equal.

not as important in lower three parts, as each instrument has different range.

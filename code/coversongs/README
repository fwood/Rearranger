Key functions:

t = tempo(d,sr);  estimates the tempo in BPM of audio waveform d at sample 
                  rate sr

b = beat(d,sr);   estimates the beat times (in sec) of audio waveform d at 
                  sample rate sr

qlist = calclistftrs(querylistfilename);
   calculates beat-synchronous chroma feature matrices for all the wav or mp3 
   files listed, one per line, in the named file, returning a list of 
   calculated feature files, then...

R = coverTestLists(qlist); 
   compares each feature file named in the qlist against every item
   and returns R as a square matrix of distance between each pair.
